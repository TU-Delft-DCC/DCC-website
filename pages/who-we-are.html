            <blockquote>
  <p>Many researchers have learned the importance of good data management and software engineering the hard way. When research outputs are not findable, code is not readable, or data published in papers is not easy to access; researchers struggle in their work because science relies on the work done by others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>Digital Competence Centre (DCC)</strong> is an on-campus initiative set up to coordinate the support on data management and software engineering required for 21st-century research. We help researchers to develop the competencies needed to do FAIR research and provide hands-on support for implementing data management workflows and developing research software. The DCC is an initiative of the Open Science Program at TU Delft to help researchers at all levels.</p>

<p>Today like never before, researchers at TU Delft produce software and large datasets as part of their research outputs. Making such datasets and software easier to find and reuse benefits a wider research community; efficient data storage and management help researchers to extend the value of their outputs beyond personal use. </p>

<h2 id="why-care-about-fair-research">Why care about FAIR Research?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make your research outputs Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More than an ideal, the FAIR principles are a set of practices that can streamline the scientific workflow to enhance the value of research outputs.</p>

<p>Within the Open Science Programme, our university is committed to making open research and open education a standard part of scientific practice. Besides, funding bodies and journals are increasingly requesting that research outputs are made Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is our ambition to be the frontrunner in this area.  Our aim is that Open Science becomes the default setting for research and education at TU Delft.” -Prof. dr. Rob Mudde, vice-rector magnificus-</p>

<h2 id="the-dcc-support-team">The DCC Support Team</h2>

<p>The DCC is the home of a Support Team consisting of <em>data managers</em> and <em>research software engineers</em> based in the TU Delft Library and ICT/Innovation department, respectively. The team’s purpose is helping researchers to develop skills to apply the FAIR principles to their research activities and reach their software development goals. The support team is an addition to the task force supporting Open Science at TU Delft, which also includes the Faculty’s ICT Managers and Data Stewards.</p>

<p>The support team of the DCC can provide researchers with IT skills, good practices and toolsets required for implementing the FAIR principles into any research project. Adopting the FAIR principles into your research project will increase the relevance and value of your research outputs (publications, data, code, etc.). Research funding bodies and open access journals are increasingly asking researchers to make their research outputs FAIR. At TU Delft, the Open Science Programme is committed to making open research and education a daily practice, and the DCC is part of that commitment.</p>

<p>The support team also accepts assignments to work closely with the research teams at TU Delft for a short period. This type of support is aimed at research projects which see the development of scientific software as one of their outcomes. Or research projects that, because of their nature, demand expert advice on the design and implementation of data management workflow for making research-outputs reusable and interoperable.</p>

<h2 id="the-dcc-team-in-action">The DCC Team in Action</h2>

<p>The DCC Support Team is already working with several research projects at TU Delft.  Researchers are realising the value of adopting basic practices in data management, such as metadata archiving and shared repositories. The team is making a positive impact in <strong>streamlining the scientific workflows</strong> that require collaboration and organisation of many datasets.</p>

<p><strong>Training and mentorship</strong> on digital competencies such as version control is also a significant gain for researchers working on projects that demand migration of programing language. Changing the source code of scientific software to easier and more popular languages, such as Python, increases the adoption and reusability of research software by the scientific community.</p>

<p>Lastly, researchers are also seeing the benefits of applying <strong>good practices for documentation</strong> and maintenance of source code, even when they are skilful in programming and have developed full-fleshed programs. The proper documentation of their software makes it easier to access, reuse it and attract new users.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-help">How We Help?</h2>

<p>Any <em>researcher</em> at TU Delft, including <em>postdoctoral researchers</em> and <em>PhD students</em>, can request support from our team of Data Managers or Research Software Engineers. You can get in contact via e-mail: dcc@tudelft.nl.</p>

<h1 id="our-support-comes-in-two-flavours">Our support comes in two flavours:</h1>
